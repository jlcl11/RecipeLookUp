# RecipeLookup üç≤

## Introduction

Welcome to RecipeLookup, a SwiftUI-based iOS application designed to help you discover and save your favorite recipes! üåü

This project was inspired by the incredible potential of VisionOS and my desire to dive into SwiftUI development. Upon exploring available APIs, I stumbled upon themealdb, which provided an extensive database of recipes perfectly suited for integration into a SwiftUI app.

## Features

- Explore a vast collection of recipes from themealdb API.
- Save your favorite recipes locally using SwiftData, Apple's local database framework.
- Seamless integration with SwiftUI for a smooth user experience.
- Dive into the world of pull requests and branches on GitHub to contribute to the project!
